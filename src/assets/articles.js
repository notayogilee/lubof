      "The Origin and Evolution of the Sanctuary of LUBOF,<br>Living in Universal Beauty as One Family",
    content:
      "<p>Every creation has its moment in time, its birth into the world of manifestation. It also has its origin, emerging from the subtle regions of the unseen. This history, or lineage permeates into the denser realities, bringing its essence, awaiting the wave of evolution to carry this new impulse into infinite possibilities.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The Sanctuary of LUBOF, had its physical birth on 1/1/2006, as an unincorporated Church Assembly, utilizing the legal structure of a Cooperation Sole, in the state of Hawaii. What this means is that those who adhere or choose to express the ideals, principles and values of the Sanctuary do not belong to a legal or social organization. The church of the Sanctuary of LUBOF is represented legally by an office, escaping the limitations of time by passing down its occupancy of the office thru the consensus choice of the Sanctuary Circle. Individual sovereignty finds collective expression within the Sanctuary Circle, allowing the connection of one’s free will and the free will of others to draw its origin from the infinite regions of human creativity within the frequency of the ideals, principles and values of the Sanctuary of LUBOF.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Throughout recorded history, people have gathered together to live as a community, receiving spiritual guidance so that the quality and expression of the community’s life strives towards the highest manifestation of love, understanding, peace, health, knowledge and harmony. In the Judaic Christian tradition, these communities received their guidance and teachings through a being named Melchizedek, mentioned in different spiritual doctrines, one that has become the pillar of the Judaic and Christian teachings, the Bible. The teachings of Melchizedek were not a religion, they became a circle of inner awareness that passed on codes of evolutionary knowledge so that human consciousness could strive towards its highest ideals. Some of these communities were known and transmitted through history, others remained hidden. Sanctuaries such as the Essenes, Bogomils, the Cathars, for example, held the principles of the teachings of Melchizedek as their guiding light.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The lineage of the Sanctuary of LUBOF has its origin in the teachings of Melchizedek. Although represented by one being, these teachings were composed of an immense circle of visible and unseen beings, each adding to the vast reservoir of human achievement. The Sanctuary of LUBOF is not the only circle that has its roots connected to this source. Many other small pockets of human beings, all over the world, from different cultures and traditions, are being drawn together by an unseen force to create ways in which our present societies can resolve the challenges they face. These circles of souls know within their hearts that by changing the quality of their individual life and finding a collective expression with others doing the same, they can contribute to bringing the diversity and differences of human beings to a greater understanding, love, peace and goodwill. These circles are all interconnected invisibly, like a spiritual internet, and when seen through our spiritual awareness, represent together a pyramid of light, shinning and bathing the earth with its life-giving rays. This is the principal role of the Sanctuary of LUBOF.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The methodologies and teachings of the Sanctuary of LUBOF touch all areas of human life, agriculture, education, worship, nature, creative expression, the pursuit of greater knowledge, healing etc. The Sanctuary of LUBOF then is an intentional environment that is dedicated to maintaining love and connection with life’s source as its goal. This is its greatest contribution to assisting in transforming the current existence of hatred, violence, ignorance, misery and disease. The Sanctuary of LUBOF adds also something new, that differs from the monasteries from the past. Instead of isolating itself behind closed walls, its doors are wide open, an open community for all races, religions, cultures, ages and consciousness. The name, Sanctuary, is an intentional circle of sacredness, and LUBOF, which stands for Living in Universal Beauty as One Family, clearly states that all human beings are brothers and sisters. We are all provided the same light from the sun, waters to drink, earth to grow our food and air to breathe. These are freely given by the universe so we all can live. Everyone on earth has the same role to steward these life-giving gifts so that each one can prosper and those that follow will have the best conditions to do the same.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The world, now, more than ever, needs living centers of awakened consciousness that will offer an example, serve as a model to achieve peace on earth. Our children absolutely from the very beginning of their lives, need to be cared for and educated that their individual desires, achievements, goals and pursuits not only need to satisfy themselves yet also must contribute to the betterment of those around them, the earth and the environment that they live in. This is what is new and different in the mission of the Sanctuary of LUBOF from its predecessors from the past. It is dedicated to serving all humanity to come together, to support one another and to cooperate with one another in finding solutions to the problems that we, as humanity created. The Sanctuary of LUBOF is not just for an isolated group of people, its circle embraces the entire earth. All our knowledge as well as our material and emotional pursuits will benefit, enhance and enrich others and the very environment we all live in.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The Sanctuary of LUBOF is dedicated to creating centers of light that are fostering the above-mentioned ideals. The Sanctuary of LUBOF fosters our multidimensional connection with universal Life and has consecrated its mission to supporting all humanity. The Sanctuary of LUBOF upholds the inherent sacredness of all life and will pass on this responsibility of caring for our dear planet earth with its different kingdoms for generations to come.</p>",

    subtitle: "",
    content:
      "<p>During the evolution of humanity, the intrinsic needs of contemplation, silence, peace and devotion has led certain individuals to form communities dedicated to cultivating these and other spiritual qualities and values.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The forms and expressions of these communities were varied, yet what ultimately connected their innermost expressions were the relationship they cultivated with nature and the intangible reality of the divine. If we examine monastic orders from all religions and spiritual communities, each, like a flower, extracted certain essences as it evolved its practices thru time.</p><br>" +
      "<p>In past traditions, such communities were the foundation for education, science, art, medicine, architecture and agriculture, contributing to the wellbeing and enrichment of the culture. In western Europe, during the rise of Christianity, a proliferation of monasteries spread, giving rise to an expansion of human advancement, while serving the needs of the human soul to commune with the source of life.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The church of the Sanctuary of LUBOF, whose roots span immemorial time, follows this river of life. It, like many of its predecessors, has birthed a Monastic Order so that the ideals and qualities, like seeds in the garden of the soul, can germinate and grow, offering the quintessence of each human experience. Like a still lake within the constant movement of human activity, it offers a reflection to the eternal presence of consciousness. The Monastic Order of the Sanctuary of LUBOF fosters the contemplation and identification with the imperceptible nature of the divine. Nestled within the womb of nature, it is nourished with the rhythms and cycles of earth.  Like so many of its forerunners, it has cultivated the earth to feed the body and soul, discovering the mysteries hidden in the pulse of life.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The evolution of humanity is rooted in the earth. To recognize the incredible abundance that nature offers allows the human spirit to calm, to perceive an environment that is supportive and intelligent, as it fulfills the basic needs of life. Understanding how nature co-exists with all the different life forms she supports, human life becomes peaceful, happy and, even when presented with natural challenges, finds the resources to harmonize the different events into a unity of experience.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The Monasteries of the Sanctuary of LUBOF sustain themselves by following the practices they developed called “Living Agriculture”. Living Agriculture is a holistic approach to living on the land. The fundamental premise is that human beings belong to, are a part of, the land. This is why the earth, in so many traditions, religions and cultures has been referred to as “Mother Earth”. Until a relatively recent time, humanity instinctively knew by caring for the earth, we care for ourselves and all of creation. By cultivating a balanced way of living, thru the basic needs of food and shelter, a sense of inner-connectedness links each individual with the source of their existence. The Monastic Order of the Sanctuary of LUBOF imbues with this simplicity. Like Saint Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan Order, it states, “If the birds and the animals have all their needs provided for by the Creator, why cannot human beings live simply on earth, in peace and happiness.”</p><br>" +
      "<p>Living Agriculture nourishes our desire to remain as a child, innocent, fresh, joyful and full of wonder. It restores the dignity and integrity of each individual, knowing they can provide for themselves and each other, a life of respect, harmony and peace. One can observe that just 150 years ago, all agricultural practices were organic. The homes were built with materials found in the environment that one was living, re-planting and conserving them for the generations to follow. The Monastic Order of the Sanctuary of LUBOF continues these traditions. By growing ones food and building ones shelters, one discovers the same principals apply to the inner life and a new sense of spirituality is born within ones soul. Learning, once again, to honor where we have come from, the earth will teach one how to move in harmony with its natural rhythms and cycles. Listening to the wisdom of the ancestors, aligning to inner spirit, one is guided into life’s sanctuary. Within life’s “sanctuary”, one is awakened into the role of stewardship, of being a co-creator with the energies of creation. Human beings have, in essence, always been gardeners, to complement the beauty of nature by adding ones own spirit to it.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The monastic order of the Sanctuary of LUBOF invites one to contemplate that all of life is infused with intelligence. All of nature has lessons to teach as one can quiet and observe life’s wonders. The practices are found in daily life, awakening to each new day to receive the blessings it will offer, in reverence for the gift to live yet another day. The beginning and end of each day has always been an integral part of all monastic orders. There is a pristine state present during these moments that have sprung from an immense well of gratitude, the source found deep within ones heart. This feeling contains the essence of the rhythm for each day. As the beating of the heart circulates the blood in our body, so the pulsation of peace and harmony bring forth the song of the soul. Each of these songs blends together into a symphony of adoration, reverberating in a “space of love.”</p><br>" +
      "<p>The life lived within the monastic order can be principally recognized by the quality of love that emanates within and throughout the land.  This can be summed up in the phrase, “the sum of the parts is far greater than the whole.” Each person that lives within a “space of love” of the Sanctuary of LUBOF adds their essence of soul life which enriches the environment to such a degree that “the whole” expands enormously. In fact, much attention is brought forth on the pollution of the earth and the consequences that humanity is facing. If we could have scientific instruments capable of measuring the effects of the different monastic orders all over the earth, we would see how much they produce counter effects to the pollution our earth is now facing. Everything we can observe physically with our 5 senses, exists first spiritually, perceptible to other senses that have remained dormant for most human beings. It is this quality of love, the pure and vibrant emanation that is cultivated in the monasteries of the Sanctuary of LUBOF, that offer the best conditions for reawakening our spiritual senses. Exactly like a blind person that finds their sight, a new vista opens up once these senses begin to function.</p><br>" +
      "<p>As our spiritual senses develop, the universe is revealed in its co creative role to support and evolve our lives on earth. These senses are able to “see beyond the form” and into the essence that infuse life forces. All that exists in a physical form could not maintain its structure if not for the life giving energies that pour from the cosmos. Although science has made immense progress through discoveries, research and applications in many of the fundamental areas of human development, it is still “an infant” when compared to what our spiritual senses reveal and evolve in the human being. This wisdom, in ancient cultures, indigenous cultures and in ancient traditions was passed down through the generations, infusing all areas of daily life. As these spiritual senses became more and more dormant, primarily caused by the dominance of our intellectual faculties, this wisdom continued and was cultivated in what is known by the term, “mystery school”. The mysteries are none other then the awakening and integration of the spiritual senses. The monastery of The Sanctuary of LUBOF has continued the work of the mystery schools and has developed a methodology to assist in the opening of these spiritual faculties, essential for our continued evolution. It is called. “Soul Essence Education”.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The integration of Soul Essence Education, within the environment of Living Agriculture allows the monastery of The Sanctuary of LUBOF to consciously participate in restoring humanities place within creation, offering to humanity the choice in a life of peace, harmony, well-being and happiness for all of earth’s children.</p><br>",

He will transform his little piece of land on our large planet into a flourishing garden, giving a material embodiment to his spirituality, following God’s example.</p>" +
      "<p>If millions of people do this in a whole lot of countries, then the whole Earth will become a flourishing garden, and there won’t be any wars, because millions of people will be engaged in a grand co-creation.”</p><br>" +
      "<p class='text-center'>According to Anastasia</p>" +
      "<p class='text-center'>Ringing Cedar Series ~ A New Civilization ~ Book 8 Part 1; p 202-203</p><br>" +
      "<p>Any creature in the universe, from the tiny insect to a planetary being or beyond, has their personal space.</p><br>" +
      "<p>When we incarnate on earth, our first “personal space” is our body. As everyone has their own body, everyone needs their little ‘nest’ to place that body. Making a ‘tree house’ or ‘clubhouse’ is a passion for all children, it starts with a box or a blanket thrown over two chairs … With that comes preparing a cup a tea or some cookies and sharing food with others … Building a home and making food is always exciting; it resonates with the innate desire to be in one’s Space of Love.</p><br>" +
      "<p>As our first Space of Love, our body feels good when all organs and functions are in a loving harmony with each other, it’s a perfect balance of ‘serving and being served’ between all. Physical food, emotional food and mental food nourishes this Space of Love and brings in harmonious or conflicting elements.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The next Space of Love is our ‘home’ hopefully with a garden surrounding, very much intertwined within its social and cultural milieu. From here we can broaden out the notion of ‘home’ into the notion of our village or town, our country, and our planet, all made up of personal Spaces of Love.</p><br>" +
      "<p>As everyone ‘builds’ their own body, physical, emotional and mental, no one else can create your personal Space of Love. Like within our body, our personal Space of Love represents a cell within the Village Space of Love who is part of an organ of the planetary Space of Love, Mother Gaia, in a perfect balance of ‘serving and being served’ between all and everyone. Everything in nature shows us this principle of co-creation.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Only humans forgot how to do this. For different reasons humans lost their innate connection with nature’s co-creation. One of the causes is that humans replaced one’s self-realization with outer accomplishments. In doing so, a never-ending search for outside achievements is put into action. When this search becomes the driving force for life, the true sense of ‘service’ gets replaced by becoming successful in the outer world. From this, lots of misunderstandings about life’s creation and co-creation result. Foremost it causes a great feeling of loneliness and emptiness in one’s consciousness, a feeling that hovers as a somber thundercloud between one’s spirit and one’s fulfillment. Imprisoned in this pattern of outer realizations, one will search more and more to try to fill in the gasps of this fruitless enterprise.</p><br>" +
      "<p>On this endless search for fulfillment, ‘money’ came on board. The tragic ending of this journey is that being successful and thriving became confused with the concept that others can do the work for you by paying for ‘their service’.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Nothing in nature works this way. No seed will delegate its branching out to another tree. No plant will buy flowers to embellish itself. No bird will pay another to build its nest. Every creature allows their authentic creative force to manifest whatever is needed in their journey. From the wondrous spider web to the intricate beaver nest, from the miraculous crystal forming to the succulent pineapple juice, everything utilizes their own creative effort and in a universal co-creation makes the most astonishing manifestations happen.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Once again, only humans forgot how to do it. Only humans believe they can get around it. Although money can make you the owner of land, can purchase a house, can hire an employee to do any job, can buy exquisite art and juicy pineapples or can afford a luxurious lifestyle, money will never offer the fulfillment of sharing your Soul Gifts. Nothing but our own effort in service to a collective wellbeing in harmony with all of Life can make you the joyful and happy co-creator.</p><br>" +

      "<p>Making choices and decisions is a path we all follow. Our body constantly makes decisions we are not consciously aware of to maintain the ability to live healthy. One could say that our health and wellbeing is the result of the choices and decisions we make. Thru past experiences we can see the results and the consequences of our choices and we can choose to correct our errors and/or, continue with ones that have brought favorable results. Our choices, consciously or unconsciously, manifest the reality in which we live in.</p><br>" +
      "<p>At birth, almost all the choices and decisions are made for us. The need to nourish to sustain our life, knowing no one can eat for us, propels the infant to cry out to be fed. More and more the infant becomes aware of his or her primal needs and that becomes the motivating factor on how they interact with others. The young child’s choices are directed by satisfying their needs. Very rarely does a young child consider the needs of others or the environment in which they are living. It is by the guiding direction of those with more wisdom, experience and responsibility that the child learns that not only they need to satisfy their needs but also need to be conscious on how these needs interact with others and the world around them.</p><br>" +

Constantly, all the different functions within the body are working together. An illness brings forth a response from the body to reestablish health.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Consensus then, is a model of collective decision making that reflects a natural state of health and wellbeing by converging the different tendencies, thoughts, emotions, opinions, perspectives etc.; in this way, the decision becomes a unified field of consciousness. Unlike other forms of decision making, consensus reflects the natural world by thriving in diversity. Through the synergy of life forces, the choice will reflect the full 360-degree viewpoints. This is a consequence when the following three principles are integrated.</p><br>" +
      "<ul class='list-disc ms-5'><li><p><strong>Opposition is an opportunity to find the best solution: there is no enemy or adversary.</strong></p></li>" +
      "<li><p><strong>Change is a part of life processes: everything expands then contracts.</strong></p></li>" +
      "<li><p><strong>The goal to achieve is a unified field of consciousness where everyone’s needs are met.</strong></p></li>" +
      "</ul><br>" +
      "<p>As these 3 principles guide the process, complexity becomes identifiable patterns in which the relationship between cause and effect becomes clear. Seeing the inevitable consequences of actions, while accepting the possibilities of change, the simplicity of agreement overrides the tendencies of disagreement. Diversity of opinion presents the opportunity of discovery and resistances to other perspectives transform into openings of solidarity where individual and group freedom merge into a harmonious whole.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Of course, these concepts seem very easy to understand. Their application, on the other hand, represents a journey as big as climbing mount Everest.</p><br>" +

      "<p>Co-creating a community is a never-ending expansive undertaking. Like the sacred geometry of the Flower of Life, circles will engender new circles wherein more circles may arise. All circles, small or big, within each other and overlapping each other, are co-creating the magical mandala of our community.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Honoring the magic of this creative expansion and honoring each one on their path and each one’s quintessence for our journey, we choose to work in what we call ‘Open Circle’.</p><br>" +

      "<p><strong>Anyone who feels called to partake in a particular circle may ask to be invited into that circle.</strong> We don’t have a pre-set rule, a specific membership or a required qualification. The members of the circle will consider your request and consent together if it feels in harmony with their present journey to open up their circle.</p><br>" +
      "<p>As an Open Circle, <strong><em>our circle is open for you to step into</em></strong>. This means that our circle did exist and function before your arrival and we graciously invite you to join and observe for a while so you can imbue yourself with the purpose, principles and methods this circle embraces. When your heart and mind are aligned with our circle, your participation will be a precious gift for an ever-unfolding co-creation.</p><br>" +
      "<p>This co-creation is the intention and driving force for our Open Circle. Grounded within the consciousness of living-in-universal-beauty-as-one-family we harmonize all our energies towards this sole direction. Our Open Circle policy is <strong><em>an inner commitment where you engage your personal journey into the collective co-creation of our vision</em></strong>.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Within our Open Circle, we make our choices in consensus. To maintain an easy flow, <strong><em>we honor, respect and value the ‘elders’</em></strong>. By ‘elders’ we mean those who by their example and experience have proven their commitment and expertise. If in your passion you involve yourself in a way that trespasses our respect zone, we will remind you to focus on and synchronize yourself with the intention of the Circle.</p><br>" +

      "<p>Our physical body is nourished and strengthen not only by the physical food we eat and drink. Foremost, it is nurtured, sustained, and strengthen by an Etheric Body, also known as our energy body. This energy body is very much in-tuned with the forces of nature, in particular the plant kingdom. We all experienced how we get invigorated during a walk through a forest, or just sitting at the ocean, looking at the night sky, or listening to the song of a rushing creek. Nature has a very comforting and rejuvenating effect on us; it’s not for nothing we call her ‘Mother Nature’.</p><br>" +
      "<p>As we open ourselves up to her, to her beauty, to her never-ending life force, to her presence all around us, we can embark on a journey of consciously communicating with her. Like any loving mother would do, she will embrace your being and offer support to you. Like any wise mother, she will be available when you are loving, kind, and cooperative with her. Her language, her methods, her actions are LOVE.</p><br>" +
      "<p class='text-center'>A very wise man, Peter Deunov, said:</p>" +
      "<p class='text-center'><em>“Be attuned to Nature and receive from her knowledge and energy. Nature is generous to those who love</em></p>" +
      "<p class='text-center'><em>her and to those whom she loves. When man makes a proper loving connection with Nature, he will</em></p>" +
      "<p class='text-center'><em>learn in one day as much as he would from a professor in twenty years.”</em></p><br>" +
      "<p>Co-creating with Nature our Space of Love represents one of the most enchanting adventures one can imagine … entering into the living world of nature is an exploration of what lies beyond each form. As we are more than our physical form, any of the plants, or animals and stones, are more than just a dog or a weed or dirt. Everything is alive and contains, like us, a sentient awareness. From the stones to the stars, everything is imbued with consciousness. When we open ourselves up to embark on a mindful relationship with them, a whole new world opens up for us in which we may discover new ways of relating to all and everyone. It’s almost as stepping into a fairytale … a world that seems like magic …</p><br>" +
      "<p>It’s not more magic than imbuing our consciousness into our body with our first breath taken in and transitioning out of it with our last breath. After which the body dissipates its form. Any form without a sentient awareness cannot continue to remain in form. Any form is an outside envelope for that consciousness. When consciousness retrieves, the form deflates, like a balloon loses its air … poofff …</p><br>" +
      "<p>The quality of how that consciousness can express itself is significantly influenced by its interaction with the surrounding. Being cared for or being abused leaves an imprint on consciousness, and thus on its quality. A happy cared-for dog will wag its tail scintillating its love all around, a beaten dog will hide fearfully in the corner, trying to survive. They both have the same potential of giving love back, but for the latter one, it’s very difficult to express it.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Integrating this understanding into our life, we recognize the importance of our environment and of the food we intake. A lot is being shared about the physical aspect of these; it does have its importance. But foremost, it is the consciousness that’s infused within these physical containers that, even though more subtle, are more important. By caring for the earth, caring for the plants and the animals, we allow them to enhance their quality and opportunity to share their essence. It is such loving co-creation we foster into our life.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The buildings, the plants, the stones, the animals, they will all ‘wag their tails’ in an abundant shower of their love upon us. And of course, we will answer with love. Hence, the co-creation of a Space of Love!</p><br>" +
      "<p>As we commune more intensively with the spirit living in each form (devic realm) we can receive their invigoration more intensively too. In doing so we can continually learn and grow in understanding and relationships with all and everything around us.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Integrating this relationship of our connectivity with the devic realms, our garden becomes a platform for expansion of our consciousness; it becomes a window into our soul.</p>",

    title: "Journey of Consensus",
    subtitle: "",
    content:
      "<p>Co-creating together as one family, we adopt <strong><em>‘consensus within the circle‘</em></strong>  as the way of functioning. In going around the circle where everyone may express themselves, we honor each point of view and respect the path each one is on. Through adopting consensus, higher consciousness and awareness reveals itself for all to see, feel and touch. Our consensus circle is a vehicle for all to come aboard and be lifted into new ways of being, evolving us towards a higher truth of the whole.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The concept of consensus as we apply it may be different than how some people understand it. Our journey of consensus is <strong><em>a journey of the heart</em></strong> ; consensus for us means to feel (sensus) together (con). Such way of consensus implies three requirements:</p><br>" +
      "<ol class='list-decimal ms-5'><li>listening to inner guidance: I connect with and follow my soul’s path</li>" +
      "<li>self-expression: I communicate what is in my heart and soul</li>" +
      "<li>feeling of oneness: I am part of all and all is part of me</li></ol><br>" +
      "<p>And a journey it is! Each one is asked to prepare oneself to contribute to a heartfelt consensus process.</p><br>" +
      "<p>It starts with opening up one’s heart. To go on our consensus journey, you are called upon to go in your own inner heart and <strong><em>step into the realm of togetherness</em></strong>, leaving behind the world of separatism created by the ego-mind. Sometimes this brings up fears, doubts, defense mechanisms, insecurities, emotional wounds, uncertainties, withdrawal, anxiety; all results of being attached to old thought-forms. “Feeling together” is the best antidote for releasing and healing those patterns. You need to have the courage and dare to step into this ‘loving space of togetherness’ where we are all one. This makes you vulnerable, yet it is this vulnerability that represents the strength of our consensus. It allows the force of love to flow amidst us. This <strong><em>process of vulnerability</em></strong> is each one’s first homework. If you don’t see to this beforehand, the whole journey of consensus will be pulled into your personal process, and instead of a discovery journey for the best choice in alignment with our vision, the journey becomes a healing work for your individual evolution.</p><br>" +
      "<p>From this feeling of togetherness, the sense of trust is awoken; trust that we are all on the same journey of manifesting our vision in the best way. This process requires a second homework: <strong><em>Is my concern the manifestation of our shared vision?</em></strong> Or, am I more interested in an expression of another vision? This question is very important to be honestly answered. No answer to this question can be a wrong answer. If your concern is the manifestation of the group’s vision, you can enter into the journey of consensus. If your concern is more towards another vision, the journey of consensus will deviate into a process of discerning where your real interest lies.</p><br>" +
      "<p>Out of respect for yourself and the group, it is better to do this homework first and in-depth before even considering participating in a consensus-journey. Take your time to discover if you can embrace the vision of the group; if that vision is in alignment with your heart’s essence and resonates with your deepest aspirations. It has to be total. You cannot embrace it halfway, because sooner or later this will engender a conflict between the group’s vision and your own. When totally embracing the group’s vision, your personal vision becomes part of this bigger vision. By consenting to the necessary steps for its manifestation, your personal vision will be taken care of.</p><br>" +
      "<p>The third homework involves the ability to <strong><em></em>focus on the concept</strong>, freed from any past or present emotional and/or mental limitations. This aspect is quite a demanding homework. It requires inner work on your feeling patterns, and an understanding of their influence on your actions and reactions, as well as on your thoughts and perceptions. If you are tangled up in emotional issues linked to a mental concept, it is impossible to journey on an honest discovery for consensus. Like a leak in a bucket, unresolved emotional incidents are wounds that will drain the love energy of the group. Sometimes this entanglement can become a huge emotional wave overwhelming the whole group, and wash away the real concept of the consensus item. To avoid this risk, it is critical to sincerely inquire if some personal problems are pulling you into an emotional state that overtakes your thinking and overloads everything with your ‘reality’. No consensus can take place in such an environment, and the whole process will become an unraveling of your emotional and/or mental entanglement.</p><br>" +
      "<p>When you find yourself in a loving space of togetherness, concerned about the manifestation of the vision and free of personal issues, you are ready to integrate the fourth homework: <strong><em>listen with wonder to every idea</em></strong> as an important input to arrive at a consensus. Without the first three conditions, this fourth approach is not possible. It takes some practice to listen openly; different methods can be brought into play like using a talking stick, or talking one by one going around the circle. Whenever you feel tense, anxious, frustrated, agitated, worried, impatient, angry, apprehensive, separated, unable to share, lonely, abandoned, ignored, excluded, etc. it is time to check if some aspects from the first three ‘homeworks’ need some attention. Sometimes some assistance can be helpful; many different tools exist to facilitate that process. It is important to be honest with yourself. Sometimes out of respect for the group, it is appropriate to first concentrate on yourself before participating in consensus.</p><br>" +
      "<p>That brings us to the fifth homework: consensus requires a level of trust, trust in yourself, trust in the others, and foremost, <strong><em>trust in the Guiding Force of the Vision</em></strong>. Journeying towards consensus is a treasure hunt for the best choice. That choice is somewhere and it is fun to search for it. We know it exists and we trust we will find it. We acknowledge that this process is far bigger than our conscious mind can grasp and we recognize its magic and innocence. We comprehend that whoever is present at the consensus circle is called to be there, and acts for the wellbeing of the vision and the wellbeing of the whole group. We are open to the unexpected explorations that can show up, allowing wonders to take place that will permit our consciousnesses to journey towards consensus.</p><br>" +
      "<p>This journeying introduces us to the sixth homework. When going on a trail with a family we don’t ask the three-year-old to carry the picnic bag for the whole group. We spontaneously value the difference between the child and the parent. Their input for consensus on what to bring will not be equal; the child recognizes the respectful quality and competence of the adult who will carry the bag. In the same manner, consensus esteems an innate respect for an intrinsic ‘expertise’ as an inner acceptance of a natural ‘esteem’. This <strong><em>intrinsic quality recognition and natural esteem</em></strong> can only express itself in a trusting and loving environment. Only love can unveil and reveal the true authenticity of each one. And only love can harmonize those differences into a happy dance of co-creation.</p><br>" +
      "<p>To participate in this dance of co-creation, we call upon the seventh homework: <strong><em>living in your Space of Love</em></strong>. Holding our origin and quintessence in love, we believe that what really and only matters is to be in that love. It is more than ‘I am in love’, it is a state of loving consciousness that is practiced, nurtured and fostered <strong><em>at every moment</em></strong>.</p><br>" +
      "<p class='text-balance text-center mx-auto'><em>In this love and this togetherness, we journey jointly in a circle and explore different possibilities that present themselves. Embracing all of the ideas, <strong>the love for our ideal guides us to choose which one represents the best option</strong>.</em></p>" +
      "<p class='text-center'><em>Our hearts consent with the choice and our minds support the direction.</em></p><br>" +
      "<p class='text-center'><em>This is how we ‘choose in consensus’.</em></p><br>",
