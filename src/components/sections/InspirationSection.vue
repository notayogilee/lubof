      <h1>OUR INSPIRATION</h1>

    <div class="">
      <p>
        We keep a deep respect and veneration towards all Masters, Guides and
        Beings who are dedicated to awaken Love, Light and Truth in humanity. We
        are greatly inspired by the Initiatic Science of the Universal White
        Brotherhood (‘Universal’ because all of Creation is included, ‘White’
        because it represents the color of a pure soul, ‘Brotherhood’ because
        all creatures have one and the same Heavenly Father and Divine Mother)
        transmitted by the Masters Peter Deunov and Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov.

        The most important aspect of this Teaching is their application in daily
        life and within a collective living environment

        “There exists one Divine Community, one Divine Nation: the Great
        Universal White Brotherhood, which the world has never seen before. This
        Brotherhood has branches on earth, in heaven and in the whole universe.
        Each one who is serving God, is a citizen of this Great Universal White
        Brotherhood which we call the Brotherhood of Divine Love, of Divine
        Wisdom, of Divine Truth. All good, honest, just and intelligent people,
        man, woman or children, all these people who are supporting the great
        principles of Love, Wisdom and Truth, independent of which church or
        party they belong, serve this Great Brotherhood. The new in the world
        has always been given by this Great Brotherhood. All the good in the
        world has been introduced by the Great Brothers and Sisters who have
        worked for the upliftment of nations. The Universal White Brotherhood is
        not something invisible. It is neither church nor a cult. It is
        something alive and beyond these corrupted conditions in which people
        live. Every member of this Brotherhood is a Manifestation of God. They
        have achieved this through hard work. Only when one can connect with the
        Great Brothers and Sisters and follow their path, can one know the new
        philosophy of Life. The Divine Teaching of the Great Brotherhood was not
        born now. It has existed since the beginning of the creation of the
        world. It has existed ever since the universe existed.

        “The time has passed when human beings were advised to live a solitary
        life in order to evolve and earn their salvation. We are now entering
        the era of brotherhood. Human beings must no longer erect barriers among
        themselves, but walk together side by side, to form a universal
        brotherhood on earth, in which all beings will form a vast family. When
        this is realized, frontiers will fall, and instead of wasting enormous
        sums of money protecting themselves from others, all nations will live
        in abundance and peace. These are the ideas that inspire the Teaching of
        the Universal White Brotherhood. They explain why our ideal is to
        develop ourselves on all levels, so that we may become examples. Our
        ideal is for all of humanity to advance together, united by this love
        that God has envisioned for all human beings. Our ideal is to live
        harmoniously within the collective life, because it is here that all
        blessings are to be found.”
